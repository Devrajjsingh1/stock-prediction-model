üìù Project Summary
Title: Apple Stock Price Forecasting using LSTM

This project focuses on predicting Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a powerful type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. The model is trained on historical stock price data to learn patterns and make future price predictions.

üìå Key Steps:
Data Collection: Historical AAPL stock price data retrieved via Yahoo Finance.

Data Preprocessing:

Normalized using MinMaxScaler.

Data split into training and testing sets.

Created sequences for LSTM input.

Model Architecture:

LSTM layers followed by Dense output layer.

Trained using mean squared error (MSE) loss.

Evaluation:

Model performance assessed on test data.

Visualized predicted vs actual stock prices using Matplotlib.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how LSTM networks can effectively capture temporal dependencies in stock market data to forecast future prices. The model showed promising performance in predicting Apple's stock trends, proving LSTM's usefulness in financial time series forecasting. While the results are encouraging, real-world stock prediction remains challenging due to market volatility and external factors. Further improvements can be made by incorporating additional features such as trading volume, sentiment analysis, or technical indicators.
